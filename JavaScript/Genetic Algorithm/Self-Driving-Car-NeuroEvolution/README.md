# Autonomous Car Neuro-Evolution with Steering Behaviour (in Perlin Noise Map)

_@author: Dishant Varshney_ (A great thanks to Daniel Shiffman for his guidance)

This project helps an AI to learn to complete the track without hitting the walls.
Algorithm based on steering behaviour and track is made randomly with Perlin Noise.

* Information about the fittest car is displayed in the canvas.
* Rendering wrt fittest car will be displayed after a car becomes stable or completes 2 laps.
* If a car succesfully completes 5 continous laps, the track will change to avoid overfitting.
* Each car is given its health (or its fuel) bar which can't be more than 10 points. After crossing each checkpoint, its health is increased.


* Feel free to fork this repo to tweak with parameters or to optimize the code or suggest some good changes.
